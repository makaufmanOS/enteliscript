# enteliscript.tui

Subpackage implementing the interactive terminal UI for `enteliscript`, 
built on the Textual framework. Provides the `TUI` application class 
(via `app.py`), custom widgets (`widgets.py`), shared types (`types.py`), 
and the command subsystem (`cmd/`), which together form a self-contained 
REPL-style interface for authenticating with and querying an enteliWEB server.
